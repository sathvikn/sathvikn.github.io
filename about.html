      <p>I was a software development engineer intern at Workday in the summer of 2019, working on a data engineering team which was part of Workday's core services. I built a command-line interface to generate data using <b>Python</b>, <b>Pandas</b>, and <b>Docker</b>, and loaded these datasets into Workday's database system with a <b>Scala</b> tool. I also developed a random forest model to predict query runtimes and identify anomalous queries, creating a feature engineering pipeline, experimenting with various regression models, and continually interpreting models and iterating on feedback from the team with various <b>Python data science tools</b>.</p>

		<p>I interned as a Data Scientist at AppliedX, part of Applied Materials's edtech division, during the summer of 2018. I created descriptive visualizations for various business units in the company using <b>Tableau</b>, preprocessing data from <b>Microsoft SQL Server</b> using <b>Pandas,</b> and analyzed major causes of roles changing using logistic regression and Bayesian inference. I also developed a <b>recommendation algorithm</b> to connect employees with one another based on content-based filtering and document similarity using <b>NLTK, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Scipy, and Numpy,</b> applied over a based of 13,000 employees. I productionized the algorithm by designing and developing a web app, and iterated on feedback from users from both within and outside the group.</p>

      <p>I interned at <a href="http://civikowl.com" target="_blank">CivikOwl</a> in summer 2017 working on <b>software development</b>. I learned technologies like <b>ReactJS, D3.js, and jQuery,</b> which greatly improved my skillset as a frontend developer, followed up on my interest in civic tech, and picked up concepts of the <b>Agile methodology, human-centered design, and product management.</b> I added major features (both web and mobile) to a web app and also created a data visualization of users' news reading habits, such as time spent and political leaning of articles read. These data were gathered through the CivikOwl Chrome extension, featured on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/civikowl">ProductHunt</a>.</p>

I built a proof-of-concept for extending FrameNet's lexical database of the English language by using <b>GloVe</b> word embeddings. I created a classifier which would predict the frame, or category, a lexical unit belongs in, with 75% accuracy using cosine similarity.</p>

I worked with <b>Web Audio API in JavaScript</b> and <b>JQuery with Bootstrap UI components</b> on the frontend, and used <b>Flask</b> on the backend, writing data to a <b>Firebase</b> database. I also worked on pipelines to analyze the data using probabilistic context-free grammar models, which involved writing a Python module to interface with parsers written in lower-level languages. I also developed a logistic regression model to predict whether a sentence would change in the experiment, based on their probabilities under various models, using <b>Numpy, Pandas, and R.</b></p>

        <p>During spring, summer, and fall terms of 2018, I was a tutor for the fastest-growing course at UC Berkeley, <a href="http://data8.org" target="_blank">Foundations of Data Science</a>, helping teach statistical inference techniques using Python. I held office hours, taught a small section, developed content with <b>Jupyter notebooks</b> and <b>LaTEX</b>, and graded assignments. I also got the opportunity to speak at UC Berkeley's undergraduate data science pedagogy workshop this summer as a student panelist, where I described my experience on Data 8 course staff to around 50 professors from universities across the United States. I've been an Undergraduate Student Instructor for the class since Spring 2018, teaching a section of 30 students and helping with various aspects of running the course.</p>

  		<p>I founded <a href='http://datascienceforindia.com' target='_blank'> Data Science for India</a> with fellow Berkeley students last May. I've largely been focusing on directing and participating in curriculum development, as well as interfacing with instructors on the ground. I devised and implemented a workflow for content development involving <b>Jupyter</b> and <b>Git</b> for coding content and Google Drive for worksheets. Our work over the summer teaching fundamental concepts of data science to 500 students in over 12 Indian high schools was recognized by the <a href="https://southasia.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/shared/newsletter/Khabar-Fall_2017.pdf" target="_blank">Institute of South Asia Studies</a> at UC Berkeley. This summer, we piloted a curriculum tailored to students on "Data Literacy," and are working on bootcamp workshops targeted to teaching Python with an emphasis on data science for high school students.</p>
