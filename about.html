  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> As a longtime Bay Area resident, I am fortunate to be exposed to a world's worth of learning opportunities both inside and outside the classroom. I strive to combine my love of learning and passion for technology with my commitment to making socioeconomic and scientific progress. </p>

  <p> <i>What am I working on? </i> This summer, I'm following up on my desire to develop technology for social change at <a href = "http://www.civikowl.com/#/"> CivikOwl</a>. Inspired by Berkeley's stellar undergraduate data science education program, I also founded <a href = "http://dsindia.github.io"> Data Science for India </a> with a classmate, such that we can ensure that students across the world can be exposed to this amazing interdisciplinary field. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to and playing music, running, and working with groups at Berkeley and beyond such as Socially Engaged Engineers, Cal's Biomedical Engineering Society, and the Alliance of South Asians Taking Action. </p>

  <p><i>Why computer science? </i> I'm amazed by how algorithmic thinking is not only crucial to the sciences, but to all areas of our lives, and by how we can use the power of computation to make leaps and bounds in critical fields, especially energy, education, and health. I'm interested in learning about a constantly changing discipline and love to read about rapidly-advancing areas, espeically data science, as well as their applications in solving the unique problems of the 21st century. </p>
