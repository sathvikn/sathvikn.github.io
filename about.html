  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> As a longtime Bay Area resident, I am fortunate to be exposed to a world's worth of learning opportunities both inside and outside the classroom. I strive to combine my love of learning and passion for technology with my commitment to making socioeconomic and scientific progress. </p>

 <p><i>What am I working on? </i> I'm a research assistant at UC Berkeley's Computational Cognitive Science Lab, where I'm helping build a web platform to run experiments that explore Bayesian models of natural language over many iterations (similar to the game of "telephone!"). I'm also following up on an educational outreach program I founded this summer, <a href = "http://dsindia.github.io"> Data Science for India </a>. In my spare time, I enjoy playing the violin and tabla (a pretty cool South Asian percussion instrument), exploring Berkeley, and learning about almost anythingâ€“ whether it's reading an article on geopolitics to checking out a new data analysis library!</p>

  <p><i>Why computer science? </i> I'm amazed by how algorithmic thinking is not only crucial to the sciences, but to all areas of our lives, and by how we can use the power of computation to make leaps and bounds in critical fields, especially energy, education, and health. I'm interested in learning about a constantly changing discipline and love to read about rapidly-advancing areas, espeically data science, as well as their applications in solving the unique problems of the 21st century. </p>
