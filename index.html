              <p>Hello! I'm a recent college graduate based in the Bay Area. Currently, I'm a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services,
                 working on Data Services for Elastic Block Store.

                This spring, I graduated from UC Berkeley with bachelor's degrees in Cognitive Science (Highest Honors) and Computer Science, where I received the <a href="https://cogsci.berkeley.edu/major-program/honors-program/robert-j-glushko-prize-distinguished-undergraduate-research"
                >Glushko Prize for Outstanding Undergraduate Research in Cognitive Sciences</a>. I also interned as a software development engineer at 
                Workday and <a href = "https://www.thefactual.com/"></a>The Factual, and a data scientist at Applied Materials, and taught both introductory and advanced courses in data science and cognitive science.

              <p>
                I'm interested in how humans' understanding of language and meaning can be modeled from a computational perspective, drawing upon tools from fields like
                natural language processing. This can improve both our understanding of language's role in human cognition and also how language technologies
                can achieve more human-like capabilities. My research has used both behavioral experiments and corpus analyses, and I'm excited to 
                further explore the field by learning more about topics like pragmatics, lexical semantics, and language acquisition.

                      <p>We investigate whether recent advances in NLP (specifically the Transformer-based neural network model BERT), are able to capture human-like distinctions between 
                        meanings of the same word, such as polysemy and homonymy. We collect human judgements of the relatedness of selected WordNet senses for 32 English words 
                        from a two-dimensional spatial arrangement task, and compare them with relatedness according to BERT vectors for these corresponding senses in the SemCor corpus.
                        We demonstrate participantsâ€™ judgments of the relatedness between senses are correlated with distances between senses in the BERT embedding space, and that BERT encodes
                        homonymous sense relations closer to human judgements than polysemous ones.

                      <p>We compared how several probabilistic generative language models, such as n-grams, probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs), and neural networks, 
                         capture human linguistic expectations in a web-based serial reproduction task, in which in which participants try to repeat sentences said by other participants,
                         similar to a game of "Telephone. We found that models that make use of preceding context, especially those with abstract representations of linguistic structure, best predict changes participants
                         made when trying to reproduce utterances in the experiment. I contributed to designing and implementing parts of the experimental interface, 
                         extracting probabilities under PCFGs, modeling which words in utterances were most likely to change under the models, and revising the final paper.

        <h3>Other Projects</h3>
          Last year, I helped with a <a href = "http://ruthefoushee.com/publications/posters/Foushee_Yang_Srinivasan_2019-BUCLD_cdscomplexity.pdf">corpus analysis</a> comparing the
          child-directed and adult-directed speech under <a href = "http://ruthefoushee.com/">Ruthe Foushee</a> (<a href = "https:/lcdlab.berkeley.edu"> 
            Language and Cognitive Development Lab</a>, PI: Mahesh Srinivasan). For this project, I extracted text from the target corpora (such as CHILDES and Santa Barbara),
            and ran exploratory analyses and permutation tests on the surprisal of child-directed and adult-directed speech.<br>
          I also participated in Berkeley's <a href = "https://lx.berkeley.edu/ugrad/lrap">Linguistic Research Apprentices Practicum (LRAP)</a>, working on annotating lexical data for  
          <a href = "https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/">FrameNet</a> and explored <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HnHmoGsHa-mZsJ4-LW_uvEGlgmUjmfrU/view">expanding the database</a> 
          with word embeddings. This work was done under <a href = "https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~dmetri/">Dmetri Hayes</a> at the International Computer Science Institute (PI: Dr. Collin Baker).
