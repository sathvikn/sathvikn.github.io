    <h1>Sathvik Nair</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm a third year undergraduate at UC Berkeley double-majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science with an emphasis on data science. My academic interests include teaching, psycholinguistics, and applications of computing to sociopolitical issues. In my free time, I enjoy playing the violin and tabla (a South Asian percussion instrument), reading and writing about history and current events, and cooking new recipes. Feel free to reach out to me at any of the links below!</p>

    <h2>What am I working on?</h2>
    <p>This semester, I'm on the teaching staff for two data science courses, tutoring <a href='https://data8.org' target='_blank'>Foundations of Data Science</a>, and assisting lab sections in <a href='https://prob140.org' target='_blank'>Probability for Data Science</a>, and also helping direct and advise an <a href='http://datascienceforindia.com' target='_blank'>educational outreach program</a> I founded last summer to promote data science education in India. I'll be taking Computer Architecture (CS 61C), Concepts of Statistics (STAT 135), Introduction to Linguistic Science (LING 100), and Contemporary Theories of Political Economy (POLECON 101). I'm also looking for internships in data science and related fields for summer 2019!</p>

		<p>This summer, I interned as a Data Scientist at AppliedX, part of Applied Materials's edtech division. I created descriptive visualizations for various business units in the company using <b>Tableau</b>, preprocessing data from <b>Microsoft SQL Server</b> using <b>Pandas,</b> and analyzed major causes of roles changing using logistic regression and Bayesian inference. I also developed a <b>recommendation algorithm</b> to connect employees with one another based on content-based filtering and document similarity using <b>NLTK, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Scipy, and Numpy,</b> applied over a based of 13,000 employees. I productionized the algorithm by designing and developing a web app, and iterated on feedback from users from both within and outside the group.</p>

      <p>I interned at <a href="http://civikowl.com" target="_blank">CivikOwl</a> last summer 2017 working on <b>software development</b>. I learned technologies like <b>ReactJS, D3.js, and jQuery,</b> which greatly improved my skillset as a frontend developer, followed up on my interest in civic tech, and picked up concepts of the <b>Agile methodology, human-centered design, and product management.</b> I added major features (both web and mobile) to a web app and also created a data visualization of users' news reading habits, such as time spent and political leaning of articles read. These data were gathered through the CivikOwl Chrome extension, featured on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/civikowl">ProductHunt</a>.</p>

  			<p>During my sophomore year, I was a research assistant at UC Berkeley's <a href="http://cocosci.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Computational Cognitive Science Lab</a> designing and developing an audiovisual web-based experiment that models a game of "Telephone," through which we examined how understanding of language changes as the same phrase is transmitted across multiple subjects. Because we needed to record and play audio from users, I used the <b>Web Audio API in JavaScript</b> for this functionality, and <b>JQuery with Bootstrap UI components</b> to take participants through the experiment. I mostly worked on the frontend, but added several backend functions in <b>Flask,</b> writing data to a <b>Firebase</b> database. I also worked on pipelines to analyze the data using probabilistic context-free grammar models, which involved writing a Python module to interface with an incremental top down parser from <a href="http://anthology.aclweb.org/J/J01/J01-2004.pdf" target='_blank'>Roark, 2001.</a> I also developed a logistic regression model to predict whether a sentence would change in the game, based on their probabilities under various models, using <b>Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.</b> I'm currently working on publishing a paper on this research.</p>

I held office hours, taught a small section, developed content with <b>Jupyter notebooks</b> and <b>LaTEX</b>, and graded assignments. I also got the opportunity to speak at UC Berkeley's undergraduate data science pedagogy workshop this summer as a student panelist, where I described my experience on Data 8 course staff to around 50 professors from universities across the United States.</p>

I've largely been focusing on directing and participating in curriculum development, as well as interfacing with instructors on the ground. I devised and implemented a workflow for content development involving <b>Jupyter</b> and <b>Git</b> for coding content and Google Drive for worksheets. Our work over the summer teaching fundamental concepts of data science to 500 students in over 12 Indian high schools was recognized by the <a href="https://southasia.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/shared/newsletter/Khabar-Fall_2017.pdf" target="_blank">Institute of South Asia Studies</a> at UC Berkeley. This summer, we piloted a curriculum tailored to students on "Data Literacy," and are working on bootcamp workshops targeted to teaching Python with an emphasis on data science for high school students.</p>

              <p><b>What we did: </b>We analyzed data from the <a href="http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/wcs/" target="_blank">World Color Survey</a> – which examined color perception in over 2500 speakers of 110 languages. The dataset contained the speakers' demographic information, so we decided to examine the differences between the responses of male and female speakers. We constructed a prototype model and aggregated each gender's distance from the model, then conducted an A/B test on the responses to test for statistical significance, concluding that there is no significant difference between the genders.</p>
              <p><b>Role: </b>I worked on visualizing the data with histograms and scatter plots and implemented algorithms to create the model and for the A/B tests.</p>

It was also my first time creating a web app with a major backend, so I learned about best practices for modularizing code.

            <p><b>Event: </b>Hack UC Santa Cruz 2017</p>
            <p><b>Team: </b>Yajushi Mattegunta(Berkeley EECS), Ivon Liu(Berkeley EECS), Sukrit Arora(Berkeley EECS), Lawrence Cheng(Berkeley EECS)</p>
            <p><b>What we did: </b> We created a Chrome extension to generate the calorie content for each ingredient in a recipe. To do this, we wrote a web scraper to access the ingredients on a recipe's website and implemented a function to recognize which part of the string is a food and which part corresponds to the amount of the food using the Google Cloud Natural Language Processing API. We then scraped the USDA Food Composition Database with the list of foods as queries, and matched the query to the entry that was the most similar. After that, we called the USDA's Food Composition Databases API to return the calories in each ingredient and converted these values to correspond to the amounts specified in the recipe.</p>
            <p><b>Role: </b>I worked on building the scrapers, calling the USDA's API, and styling the extension.</p>
            <p><b>Tools Used: </b> Python, JavaScript, CSS, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Google Cloud NLP API</p>
            <p><b>What I learned: </b>I found that when there isn't a readily available API, web scraping is always an option. I also learned the importance of partitioning tasks when working on teams to create a finished product.</p>

            <p><b>Course: </b>CS 61B(Algorithms and Data Structures) Final Project</p>
            <p><b>What I did: </b>I wrote the backend of a web server to display a map of the area around Berkeley. This app supported operations such as scrolling, zooming, and route finding. I constructed a quadtree of image files to be rendered based on a query, and implemented the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between points on the map.</p>
            <p><b>Tools Used: </b> Java, Maven, XML, OpenStreetMap data</p>
            <p><b>What I learned: </b>I made key decisions about which data structures to use based on technical specifications and learned about connecting real-world data with structures like graphs.</p>
