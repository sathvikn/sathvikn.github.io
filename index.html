    <h1>Sathvik Nair</h1>
    <p>I'm a second year undergraduate studying cognitive science and computer science at UC Berkeley. I love learning about human behavior and decision making processes, and I'm amazed by how advances in computation can allow us to create tools to make more informed, data-driven decisions which can advance our society. As a result, I'm interested in product management, data science, software development, and user experience research. Currently, I'm researching <a href="http://cocosci.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">natural language processing</a> and working in data science education, both <a href="http://data8.org" target="_blank">at Berkeley</a> and <a href="http://datascienceforindia.com" target="_blank">across the world</a>. In my free time, I enjoy playing the violin and tabla (a South Asian percussion instrument), reading about history and current events, and trying out new recipes.</p>

      <p>I interned at <a href="http://civikowl.com" target="_blank">CivikOwl</a> last summer 2017 working on <b>software development</b>. I learned technologies like <b>ReactJS, D3.js, and jQuery,</b> which greatly improved my skillset as a frontend developer, followed up on my interest in civic tech, and picked up concepts of the <b>Agile methodology, human-centered design, and product management.</b> I added major features (both web and mobile) to a web app and also created a data visualization of users' news reading habits, such as time spent and political leaning of articles read. These data were gathered through the CivikOwl Chrome extension, featured on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/civikowl">ProductHunt</a>.</p>

            <p><b>Role: </b>On the backend, I worked on cleaning the data and used these data to create endpoints for a web server. On the frontend, I created the user interface such that it effectively displayed data from the backend on a map of the US.</p>

              <p><b>What I learned: </b>This was my first time creating a product from scratch in a professional setting, so I was able to fully explore how the connects the designs and the backend through communicating with my mentors. I had to make major design decisions for myself, such as how to effectively format data from the backend and what libraries to use for data visualization. I also taught myself D3.js and JQuery in under a week in order to meet all the specifications.</p>

              <p><b>What we did: </b>We analyzed data from the <a href="http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/wcs/" target="_blank">World Color Survey</a> – which examined color perception in over 2500 speakers of 110 languages. The dataset contained the speakers' demographic information, so we decided to examine the differences between the responses of male and female speakers. We constructed a prototype model and aggregated each gender's distance from the model, then conducted an A/B test on the responses to test for statistical significance, concluding that there is no significant difference between the genders.</p>
              <p><b>Role: </b>I worked on visualizing the data with histograms and scatter plots and implemented algorithms to create the model and for the A/B tests.</p>

            <p><b>Team: </b>Ajoy Sojan (CTO), Michelle Lee(UI/UX, Product), Arjun Moorthy(CEO), Pradeep Keshary (Frontend Developer) </p>
            <p><b>What we did: </b>We created a web and mobile platform for users to anonymously discuss news articles, gain thoughtful insights about current issues, and and contact their government officials if they were passionate about a topic.</p>
            <p><b>Role: </b> I worked on developing features and fixing bugs on the frontend, shipping code to production, going from working on small visual bugs to creating entirely new components. Some features I worked on involved sending and receiving data from the backend and developing mobile versions of features present on our desktop client.</p>
            <p><b>Tools Used: </b>ReactJS, SASS, Webpack, Babel, AWS</p>
            <p><b>What I learned: </b>This was my first time doing frontend development in a professional setting, so I experienced the process of agile software development and code review, and working with a large code base. I also learned about the React JavaScript framework and effectively deploying code via AWS.</p>

            <p><b>What I did: </b>A web app that helps users voice talk to their representatives about the issues they care about. I had read about the effectiveness of calling your representatives and the importance of state legislators when making policies. As a result, I decided to consolidate features like showing users contact info and online profiles for both their members of Congress and their state legislatures in addition to looking up and filtering current legislation, into one website.</p>
            <p><b>Tools Used: </b>Python, Flask, Open States API, Sunlight Congress API (Currently deprecated), HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Flask, Jinja2, Heroku</p>
            <p><b>What I learned: </b>I learned how to use RESTFful APIs and Python for server-side development, and connected this with my knowledge of web development. I also learned about the process of deploying apps on cloud services such as Heroku and AWS.</p>

            <p><b>Event: </b>Berkeley Builds 2017</p>
            <p><b>Team: </b>Aaryaman Sen(Berkeley CogSci), Tejal Gala(Berkeley BioE), Aditya Palacharla(Berkeley BioE)</p>
            <p><b>What we did: </b>We designed a mobile app that would improve users' experiences when searching for community resources. We partnered with the nonprofit Health Leads, which seeks to improve the quality of their clients' medical care by helping them seek out resources such as food pantries to ensure they maintain a healthy diet. To offer a clean user experience, we decided to host their online services on a mobile platform, which would use speech recognition and natural language processing, as well as take the users' history into account when accessing Health Leads's services.</p>
            <p><b>Role: </b> I helped wireframe parts of the app and conduct research.</p>
            <p><b>Tools Used: </b> Sketch, Figma</p>
            <p><b>What I learned: </b>This was my first UI/UX design project, so I learned about human-centered design processes and best practices for designing a clean, intuitive user interface. </p>

            <p><b>Event: </b>Hack UC Santa Cruz 2017</p>
            <p><b>Team: </b>Yajushi Mattegunta(Berkeley EECS), Ivon Liu(Berkeley EECS), Sukrit Arora(Berkeley EECS), Lawrence Cheng(Berkeley EECS)</p>
            <p><b>What we did: </b> We created a Chrome extension to generate the calorie content for each ingredient in a recipe. To do this, we wrote a web scraper to access the ingredients on a recipe's website and implemented a function to recognize which part of the string is a food and which part corresponds to the amount of the food using the Google Cloud Natural Language Processing API. We then scraped the USDA Food Composition Database with the list of foods as queries, and matched the query to the entry that was the most similar. After that, we called the USDA's Food Composition Databases API to return the calories in each ingredient and converted these values to correspond to the amounts specified in the recipe.</p>
            <p><b>Role: </b>I worked on building the scrapers, calling the USDA's API, and styling the extension.</p>
            <p><b>Tools Used: </b> Python, JavaScript, CSS, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Google Cloud NLP API</p>
            <p><b>What I learned: </b>I found that when there isn't a readily available API, web scraping is always an option. I also learned the importance of partitioning tasks when working on teams to create a finished product.</p>

            <p><b>Course: </b>CS 61B(Algorithms and Data Structures) Final Project</p>
            <p><b>What I did: </b>I wrote the backend of a web server to display a map of the area around Berkeley. This app supported operations such as scrolling, zooming, and route finding. I constructed a quadtree of image files to be rendered based on a query, and implemented the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between points on the map.</p>
            <p><b>Tools Used: </b> Java, Maven, XML, OpenStreetMap data</p>
            <p><b>What I learned: </b>I made key decisions about which data structures to use based on technical specifications and learned about connecting real-world data with structures like graphs.</p>
