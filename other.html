  <p style = "font-size: 20">I find it effective and enjoyable to put my opinions into words. I learned this through giving speeches on current events as a speech and debater and high school and now utilize this voice to articulate my perspectives, whether they're about my personal experiences or issues in society.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Studying computer science at Berkeley and just seeing <a href = "http://projects.dailycal.org/cs-gender/">how few women there were in my classes</a> led me to reflect on the lack of female representation in STEM fields, such as identifying causes and thinking of solutions. After all, if innovation benefits society, shouldn't society be represented in its innovators?</p>

  </div>
  <p>This was part of a crowdsourced letter-writing project that set out to combat anti-Blackness after the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile in July 2016. The project was started by Asian-American activists and I felt that the original letter could do more to resound more with the South Asian community.</p>
