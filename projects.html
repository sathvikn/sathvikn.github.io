  <h1>Coding Projects</h1>
<div class = 'col-md-6'>
<h3> <i> Hackathons and Personal Projects </i> </h3>
  <h2> Carbon Tweetprints </h2>
  <p>Completed at the Berkeley Energy and Resources Collaborative (BERC) 2017 Hackathon. Visualizing data on the geographic location of tweets about climate change in relation to the sources of carbon emissions in the US. We gathered data from the Twitter API and the Energy Information Administration, then built endpoints to display our data on a map of the US. I worked on cleaning up data on carbon emissions with Pandas, building Flask endpoints, and calling the Google Maps API on the frontend. Languages/Technologies: Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Pandas, Tweepy, Numpy, Scikit-learn(for clustering), Flask, JQuery, Google Maps API</p>
  <h2> Project Virulence </h2>
  <p>Completed at CalHacks 4.0, a web application that predicts the lethality of the flu virus when different strains exchange genetic information. We accessed and manipulated genetic and protein data on 18,000 strains of the flu virus with Pandas and web scraping, and then used results from a recent research paper to determine if these strains were deadly. I primarily worked on organizing the data, scraping the NIH website, and setting up the web application. Languages/Technologies: Python, CSS/HTML, Pandas, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Flask, Bootstrap</p> 
 <h2> Food Analyzer </h2>
   <p> A Chrome extension to generate the calorie content for each ingredient in a recipe that received 3rd place in the Tech Cares category at Hack UC Santa Cruz 2017. We wrote a web scraper to access the ingredients on a recipe's website and implemented a function to recognize which part of the string is a food and which part corresponds to the amount of the food using the Google Cloud Natural Language Processing API. We then scraped the USDA Food Composition Database with the list of foods as queries, and matched the query to the entry that was the most similar using Python's DiffLib library. After that, we called the USDA's Food Composition Databases API to return the calories in each ingredient and converted these values to correspond to the amounts specified in the recipe. I primarily worked on the scrapers(built using Scrapy and BeautifulSoup), calling the USDA's API, and some CSS to style the extension. Languages/Technologies: Python, JavaScript, CSS, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup. <a href = "https://devpost.com/software/food-analyzer">Devpost.</a></p>
 <h2> Legislate </h2>
    <p> A <a href = "https://yourgovyourvoice.herokuapp.com"> web app </a> that helps users voice talk to their representatives about the issues they care about. I had read about the effectiveness of calling your representatives and the importance of state legislators when making policies. As a result, I decided to consolidate features like showing users contact info and online profiles for both their members of Congress and their state legislatures in addition to looking up and filtering current legislation, into one website. I built it using a Flask backend, calling the Google Maps API to return a user's location given an address, and used this information with the Sunlight Congress(currently unavailable) and Open States APIs to generate information about both legislators and bills. I learned a lot about how to integrate APIs to develop my own project, as well as interesting areas of computer science such as Internet architecture (I considered using a user's IP address to generate their location) and RSA encryption (needed to configure the web server). Languages/Technologies: Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flask, Jinja2. </p>

  <h2> Text Encryption </h2>
    <p> A short summer project before freshman year in college. I read Simon Singh's The Code Book and decided to implement certain encryption algorithms(the Caesar and Vigènere ciphers and a onetime pad) into Python by adjusting the ASCII characters corresponding to user-inputted text. Works using a command-line interface.</p>
  <h2>Pairing Speech Students</h2>
   <p>My first completely independent project. As a chair on the speech and debate team, I needed to organize practice sessions, which involved students speaking to another and giving each other feedback. I wrote a Python script to read from the roll sheet and pair speakers up based on their skill level and content knowledge. I modified the script to generate pairings for my high school's in-house tournaments.</p>

      <h3> <i> Classes and Research </i> </h3>
    <h2> BearMaps </h2>
    <p> For this project, I wrote the backend of a web server to display a map of the area around Berkeley. This app supported operations such as scrolling, zooming, and route finding. I constructed a quadtree of image files to be rendered based on a query, and implemented the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between points on the map (obtained through parsing an XML file of Open Street Map data). Class: Algorithms and Data Structures. Languages/Technologies: Java, Maven, XML</p>
    <h2> Database </h2>
    <p> I built a relational database management system from scratch. Parsed queries using regular expressions and determined methods to call (creating, joining, inserting into, and deleting from tables, storing in/loading from database). Conducted operations on a linked list of hashmaps to respond to user queries. Class: Algorithms and Data Structures. Languages/Technologies: Java.
    <h2> Effects of Gender on Color Perception </h2>
    <p> I analyzed data from the <a href = "http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/wcs/data.html"> World Color Survey </a> – which examined color perception in over 2500 speakers of 110 languages. The dataset contained the speakers' demographic information, so I decided to examine the differences between the responses of male and female speakers. I constructed a prototype model and aggregated each gender's distance from the model, then conducted a permutation test on the responses to test for statistical significance. Class: Data Science and the Mind </p>
    <h2> Song Classifier </h2>
    <p> I implemented a k-nearest neighbors classifier to distinguish hip-hop songs from country songs. I used the frequencies of a set of words in a song and calculated the Euclidean distance between the frequency vector of a song in a test set and songs in the training set. Class: Foundations of Data Science </p> 
    <h2> Scheme Interpreter</h2>
  <p>I used Python to evaluate expressions in the Scheme programming language and support features such as defining and calling functions, conditional statements, boolean logic, and tail recursion. Course: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.</p>

<h2>Spectral Analysis</h2>
  <p>Developed during my internship with the astronomy and astrophysics department at UC Santa Cruz. We analyzed spectra from accretion disks, bodies that surround active galactic nuclei, so that we could reconcile observed data with theoretical calculations. We found that the temperature decreases at a slower rate with resprect to the radius than predicted and that the disks are larger than their predicted sizes. I primarily worked on generating a spectral model based on accretion disk theory and modifying the radial temperature distribution to fit with observed data. Worked using Python with Numpy and Matplotlib. </p>
